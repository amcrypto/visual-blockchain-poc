Ardor visual blockchain proof of concept

Development Roadmap

    A 3d visual live representation of the Ardor ecosystem.
        Basic visual representations of block chain elements
            Blocks
            Transactions
            Unconfirmed transactions
                Current dissolve effect is using a third party shader
            Active Peers
                Rough Geo-location data for peers (Mapbox and ip_api.com integration)
    Still needed
        Enable interactivity between the player and blockchain elements
        Expandable visual data for each block, transaction, asset etc…
        Visual representation for the transaction activity of important accounts (Exchanges, Developers rich lists, most active etc…)
        Integration with Steam VR controls through Unity
        Overhaul graphics and environment
    Ideas to create a framework for smooth integration between Unity3D and the Ardor Network
        Create objects that mach Ardor data types for easy manipulation in Unity
        Create basic functions for communication with the Ardor Network
        Create Demo scenes with examples of different types of blockchain interaction
        Create an asset on the Unity asset store to enlarge the group developers exposed to the Ardor API
