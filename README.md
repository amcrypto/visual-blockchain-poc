Ardor visual blockchain proof of concept

Basic visual representations of block chain elements
    Blocks
    Transactions

Still needed

    Enable interactivity between the player and blockchain elements
    Expandable visual data for each block, transaction, asset etc…
    Visual representation for the transaction activity of important accounts (Exchanges, Developers rich lists, most active etc…)
    Integration with Steam VR controls through Unity
    Overhaul graphics and environment

Ideas to create a framework for smooth integration between Unity3D and the Ardor Network

    Create objects that mach Ardor data types for easy manipulation in Unity
    Create basic functions for communication with the Ardor Network
    Create Demo scenes with examples of different types of blockchain interaction
    Create an asset on the Unity asset store to enlarge the group developers exposed to the Ardor API
