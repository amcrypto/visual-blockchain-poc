Ardor visual blockchain proof of concept

	Goals:
A 3d visual live representation of the Ardor ecosystem.
Basic visual representations of block chain elements
Blocks
Transactions
Unconfirmed transactions
Current dissolve effect is using a third party shader
Active Peers
rough Geo-location data for peers (Mapbox and ip_api.com integration)
Still needed
Enable interactivity between the player and blockchain elements
Expandable visual data for each block, transaction, asset etc...
visual representation for the transaction activity of important accounts (Exchanges, Developers rich lists, most active etc...)
Integration with Steam VR controls through unity
Overhaul graphics and environment
Ideas to create a framework for smooth integration between Unity3D and the Ardor Network
Create objects that mach Ardor data types for easy manipulation in unity
Create basic functions for communication with the Ardor Network
Create Demo scenes with examples of different types of Blockchain interaction
Create an asset on the unity asset store to enlarge the group developers exposed to the Ardor API
